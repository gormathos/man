An integer matrix $A_{n\times m}$ consisting of $n$ rows and $m$ columns is given:
$$
A_{n\times m} = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1m} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots.
a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \cdots & a_{nm}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
It is known that $|n - m| = 2$.

Write a program that removes two rows or two columns from the matrix $A$ so that the square matrix $B$ with the maximum determinant is obtained.
If there are several ways to remove two rows or two columns so that the square matrix $B$ with maximum determinant is obtained, you can choose any of them.


\InputFile
Your program receives matrix $A$ with the number of rows and the number of columns differing by 2.

\OutputFile
In the first line print the number $n$ $-$ the dimension of the square matrix $B$ with the maximum determinant, 
which is obtained from matrix $A$ by deleting two rows or two columns. 

In the next $n$ rows output matrix $B$.
In the last line print the determinant of matrix $B$.

\Constraints

$2 \le n \le 10$

$-10 \le a_{ij} \le 10$
