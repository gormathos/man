\begin{problem}{Numpy: sum, min, max}{input.npz}{}{2 seconds}{256 megabytes}

You are given several one-dimensional numeric arrays. In each array, you need to find:
\begin{itemize} 
\item sum of all elements of the array;
\item the minimum element in the array;
\item the maximum element in the array;
\item indices of all minimum elements in the array;
\item indices of all maximal elements in the array.
\end{itemize}

\InputFile
Your program should read arrays from the file {\t {<<input.npz>>>}}.
The number of arrays in the input file does not exceed 20.
The number of elements in each array does not exceed $500\,000$.
The elements of the arrays do not exceed $1\,000\,000$ in absolute value.

\OutputFile.
Print three lines for each array from the input file:
\begin{itemize} 
\item in the first line print the sum, minimum and maximum with a space;
\item in the second line print the indices of all minimum elements in the array;
\item in the third line print the indices of all the maximum elements in the array.
\end{itemize}


\Example

\exmpfile{01.in}{01.out}%
