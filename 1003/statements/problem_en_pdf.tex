\begin{problem}{Numpy: where}{input.npz}{}{2 seconds}{256 megabytes}.

You are given several one-dimensional numeric arrays. 
In each array, you need to find elements whose value is between 1 and 9 inclusive.

\InputFile
Your program should read arrays from the file {\t {<<input.npz>>>}}.
The number of arrays in the input file does not exceed 20.
The number of elements in each array does not exceed $500\,000$.
The elements of the arrays do not exceed $1\,000\,000$ in absolute value.

\OutputFile.
Print three lines for each array from the input file:
\begin{itemize} 
\item in the first line is the number of elements whose value is in the range from 1 to 9 inclusive;
\item in the second line output the elements whose value is in the range from 1 to 9 inclusive;
\item in the third line print the sum of elements whose value is in the range from 1 to 9 inclusive.
\end{itemize}


\Example
\begin{example}
\exmpfile{01.in}{01.out}%
\end{example}
